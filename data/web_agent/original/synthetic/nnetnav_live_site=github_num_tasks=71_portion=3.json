The search query \"AI-powered development projects\" is quite broad and doesn't seem to directly relate to the Copilot feature or plans. The user's intention became clearer upon reaching the search results page, particularly when they filtered the results by language. Considering these actions, it's likely that the user is searching for open-source code repositories related to AI projects written in various programming languages. However, there is no clear indication of a specific AI-powered development project. This task could be further exploration or research. A direct question could be, \"Find Github repositories containing code for a particular form of Artificial Intelligence ADA type natural language processing code that are coded in at least multiple languages.\"",
