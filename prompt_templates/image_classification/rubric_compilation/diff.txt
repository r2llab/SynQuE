Given some samples from image classification dataset A and dataset B, list how dataset B is different from dataset A. Similar characteristics are provided below for reference. Return ${num_points} points that summarize the characteristics of the two datasets (e.g., dataset A is ... dataset B is ...). Focus on the characteristics of the images in terms of how they are structured, styled, or captured (e.g., lighting, background, composition, etc.) rather than the image specifications such as resolution, size, etc. Output should be a JSON list of strings.

Similar characteristics:
